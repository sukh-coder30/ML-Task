# ML-Task
To complete this task, I began by reviewing and understanding the structure and contents of the Titanic dataset. I imported all the necessary libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and warnings, to support data analysis and visualization.
I then loaded the dataset from a CSV file and displayed it to inspect the data. This was followed by an initial exploration, where I examined the number of rows and columns, along with the data types of each feature.
Next, I checked for missing values and handled them appropriatelyâ€”by imputing with suitable values where necessary and dropping columns that were irrelevant or contained excessive missing data. After cleaning the null values, I applied feature scaling to standardize the numerical features.
Finally, I visualized potential outliers using boxplots and removed them using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to ensure the dataset was clean and ready for further analysis or modeling.
